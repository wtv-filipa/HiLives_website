                        <p class="modal__text text-justify">The University of Aveiro (UA), with 15000 students, being 80 with Special
                            Educational Needs, possesses a significant experience in the field of supporting social and
                            educational inclusion, both inside the university and in the community. The research team
                            comes from 2 of the 19 research centers that are hosted in UAVR. UA offers opportunities to
                            a wide and diverse public, to share knowledge and practices, to conceive new ways of
                            cooperating and intervening in society, being host of multiple conferences and seminars in
                            the field of inclusion. With specific expertise in Diversity, Curricular Development and in
                            Digital Inclusion, UA developed a pilot-study involving five students with IDD, designed to
                            strengthen the ‘big’ project which aims to create a University Studies Path, founded in a
                            person-centered approach and curriculum, addressed to students who have finished compulsory
                            education but cannot accede to Higher Education by the regular entry. Additionally, UA has
                            recently been distinguished with the “Inclusive Employee Entity Brand”, a public distinction
                            of the entities that recognize their workers as unique people in their diversity, standing
                            out for their involvement in promoting employability and non-discrimination of people with
                            disabilities. Within the UA, there are diverse resources assigned to attend the SN of either
                            students, employees or collaborators. Among them, we can point the Pedagogical Office, the
                            Service of Assistance to Users with Special Needs, available in the UA Library, and even
                            participation in cooperation projects abroad, such as "Ria sem Limites" Project (adapted
                            sailing). The members of UA involved in the project are experts in the field of special
                            needs and inclusion, digital tools applied to inclusion, curriculum development,
                            administration & educational policies, person-centered educational approach and sociology.
                            HiLives Project is the optimal space to build, in a collaborative dynamic, the knowledge
                            that such a subject as inclusion demands.

                            Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland. A modern, diversified, and rapidly developing
                            institution, the UI offers opportunities for study and research in 400 programs, spanning
                            most fields of science and scholarship. The UI is organized into five schools: Social
                            Sciences, Health Sciences, Humanities, Education, Natural Sciences, and Engineering. The
                            School of Education at the UI, educates teachers for preschools, primary schools, and upper
                            secondary schools, sports and health scenes, social educators, and leisure professionals.
                            All academic programs at the School of Education are strongly linked to the workplaces of
                            those professions the school educates, such as schools and other societal institutions. The
                            programs provide a wide range of professional options, and serve as a good foundation for
                            further studies.
                            The vocational Diploma program for students with intellectual disabilities is hosted inside
                            the faculty of Health, promotion, Sport and Leisure Studies and in collaboration with other
                            faculties inside the School of Education. The diploma program at the University of Iceland
                            has been based on an inclusive individualized model from the start, where students receive
                            individualized support in order to access college courses. The diploma program is based on a
                            social understanding of disability which draws attention to the environment and the need for
                            social change instead of focusing on individual limitations and impairments and on the
                            understanding that inclusive education should be available to all students at all education
                            levels and students should be granted the support they need to be included in the academic
                            and social life of the university. Students also receive on site job training at local
                            preprimary schools, after school clubs or within the field of disability and self advocacy.
                            Two part time staff members (70 % each) coordinates the program and ensure that students
                            receive the support and accommodation they need, also there is an academic committee which
                            is concerned with research and development of the program.

                            main public research organisations in Spain. The University of Salamanca supports the
                            Research and Development activities of its scientific community, public institutions and
                            industry, thanks to a set of scientific and technological consulting resources: a network of

                            several Central Management Services. Its strong engagement in international collaborations
                            is supported by cooperation agreements in force with over 300 institutions around the world
                            and by the participation of its researchers in several international projects, in particular
                            under the European Programmes, where the university has acted in a wide range of profiles

                            Competencies" of the University of Salamanca aimed at people with intellectual and
                            developmental disabilities. The objective of this title of the University of Salamanca is to
                            facilitate the employment inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities or development
                            in the ordinary company. To do this, participants receive training in social and labor
                            competencies and also carry out work practices. The UNIdiVERSITAS program is an own title of
                            38 ECTS credits and it is developed from November to June. UNIdiVERSITAS is now funded by
                            the ONCE Foundation for the Cooperation and Social Inclusion of People with Disabilities and
                            the European Social Fund. USAL-INICO brings a clear added value to HiLives Project, mainly
                            considering its projection to all iberoamerican countries. Finally, INICO is part of the
                            network of 20 Spanish universities developing training programs for people with intellectual
                            disability, being pioneers in Spain in this type of programs.

                            universities counting over 46,000 students and 15,000 employees. Located in Flanders, the
                            Dutch-speaking part of Belgium and the cultural and economical heart of Europe, Ghent
                            University is an active partner in national and international educational, scientific and
                            industrial cooperation. With a view to cooperation in research and scientific service,
                            numerous research groups, centres and institutes have been founded over the years. Several
                            of them are renowned worldwide, in various scientific disciplines such as biotechnology,
                            aquaculture, microelectronics, history,...We distinguish ourselves as a socially committed
                            and pluralistic university in a broad international perspective. Ghent University has
                            adopted an active policy of internationalization which, relying on the university’s
                            embeddedness in its own language and culture, focuses on external contacts, exchanges and
                            collaborations in terms of both research and education. This is a enrichment and is
                            preferable to a more self- centred attitude. It not only involves collaborations with
                            renowned institutions at the thematic, regional and multilateral level, but also development
                            cooperation with partners in the south. This way, Ghent University strives to be a link in
                            the production and circulation of knowledge worldwide. After all, knowledge is one of the
                            most vital resources that we have. It cannot simply be created in cooperation with the
                            strongest possible academic partners, but should be shared with partners in the south, not
                            only because this is the right thing to do but also to achieve mutual development. “The
                            university is not alone” is an important element in Ghent University’s self- awareness.
                            Multiperspectivism is reflected in the realization that the university as a knowledge centre
                            is but one link in the wider knowledge ecology that drives our society.

                        <p class="modal__text text-justify">ASSOL is a NGO, located in Oliveira de Frades, a village in the Center of
                            Portugal, founded in 1987 by families of people with disabilities and a group of interested
                            citizens. At that time, in our region did not exist any support for people with
                            disabilities, a few of them were supported in specialized institutions in Viseu and the
                            families were the only caregivers of these people.
                            Having started in 1989 with the first vocational training courses for 25 people with
                            disabilities, ASSOL made a path along which, in partnership with the responsible public
                            services and community organizations, namely companies, built a net of services that, thirty
                            years later, supports around 1000 people with disabilities at different ages and also adults
                            with disabling chronic mental illness.
                            These services net include: Early Intervention; Resource Centre for Inclusion in regular
                            schools; Vocational Training; Resource Centre for Qualification and Support Employment; CAO
                            - Day centres for adult people with severe disabilities; USO - Day centres for adult people
                            with disabling chronic mental illness; GAPRIC – Support to young and adult people to do
                            activities in community and Residential care, provide by a sheltered home and foster
                            families.
                            ASSOL’s greatest wish is to provide our region with a support network able to facilitate
                            familiar and social inclusion of disabled people and where everybody can get services they
                            want when they need.
                            Our values are: Respect; Nonviolence; Justice; Inclusion; People empowerment; Work in
                            partnership; Continuous improvement and Equitable relationships between caregivers and
                            people served.
                            The aim of our work is to help each person to optimize their abilities and their quality of
                            life and to have a participation recognized as valuable in the life of their family and
                            their community.
                            To achieve these objectives, ASSOL adopted Person-Centred Planning and Gentle Teaching as
                            main methodologies.

                        <p class="modal__text text-justify">AVISPT21 was created in 1996, by a group of parents of children with Down
                            Syndrome. It assumed as a mission the implementation of actions related to scientific,
                            educational, research and social aspects related to Down Syndrome, as well as other
                            developmental disabilities. Since then, it has expanded its activities to support programs
                            for individuals with special needs, namely in the support of some transition moments. GAPRIC
                            (Community Entity Support Office) is one of those programmes: It is a modality that emerges
                            as an answer to individuals with disabilities/health problems in the transition process to a
                            post-scholar life (social and work contexts).

                            The Development Center was created, as an autonomous unit of AVISPT21, to provide
                            therapeutic help to youngsters and families, concerning health and education, with
                            scientific advisor of the paediatrician Miguel Palha. We support children and youngsters
                            throughout their life stages. A multidisciplinary team, composed by psychologists,
                            therapists, a social worker, and a special education teacher, focus their intervention on
                            community services as well as in a close relationship to scholar contexts.

                            We have developed inclusion projects through art, in which young people with disabilities
                            learn techniques and develop pieces with peers of the same age, in partnership with public
                            institutions and visual artists.

                            Recently, a concern for young people who dream about continuing to study in higher
                            education, led us to begin projects with higher education institutions.

                            AVISPT21 keeps working to promote social inclusion of individuals with disabilities through
                            the involvement of families and all the community in raising awareness for inclusive
                            education and full participation of everyone.

                            We believe in self-determination and in the potential of each person, through education and
                            the involvement in a community they are entitled to, to build a more inclusive society.

                            organizations who support persons with disabilities (PwD) in their professional
                            qualification and labour aspirations. Our affiliates are distributed all over Portugal and
                            our head office is in Coimbra, where our two full-time paid staff develops the tasks set by
                            an unpaid executive board composed by 5 elements (elected every 3 years by the affiliates of
                            the Federation). As an umbrella organization in the field of social inclusion, our action is
                            focused on getting the best outcomes, in the changing environment, for the PwD and the
                            organization we directly represent. To operationalize that we: 1. Shape and influence public
                            policies towards vocational training and employment of PwD, in cooperation with the public
                            bodies such as the Portuguese Institute for Employment and Vocational Training (IEFP) and
                            the National Institute for Rehabilitation (INR); 2. Empower the endogenous capacities of our
                            affiliates, promoting a spill-over effect towards the social sector in general, by
                            developing a variety set of sharing and learning activities. Our benchmarking and
                            benchlearning dynamics, that started in 2012 using as main guidelines the requirements set
                            by EQUASS - European Quality in Social Services, are a good example how the sharing process
                            can improve quality and accountability of the support given to PwD. 3. Dissemination and
                            production of knowledge in the field of vocational training, employment, and quality of life
                            for PwD. FORMEM’s Academy, our annual one-week conferences and debates (everyday with
                            different subjects and speakers), presents itself has a mark of this effort. FORMEM has also
                            an active role in civil society, either in Portugal and in Europe, where we believe that
                            genuine learning and sharing expertise can be driven forces for a more inclusive, effective
                            and efficient society. Our participation in HiLives Project, co-funded by Erasmus+ Program
                            of the European Union, may encapsulate our will and capability to be part of the empowering
                            movement for PwD.

                            schooling providing social responses, alternative to those available in the municipality, so
                            they become independent and well-adjusted citizens and respond to their family needs. The
                            GAPRIC (Support Offices for Included Programs in the Community) Project philosophy forms the
                            basis of all the activity we develop which aims to facilitate and promote the
                            socio-professional integration of young people with disabilities, through the construction
                            of a community support network capable of creating responses that promote their autonomy,
                            personal fulfilment and self-determination, and to promote the responsibility of the
                            community itself in the process of including people with disabilities. Following a
                            Person-Centred Planning approach, that allows the identification the participant's dreams,
                            desires, and motivations, the technical team elaborates a medium term long individual life
                            plan according to individual needs, interests, and decisions. We promote well-structured
                            recreational, cultural, sports, personal and social development activities, and
                            socio-professional experiences. We encourage and participate in community events to
                            publicize our institution and the work we do to be able to serve more families that need our
                            support. We want our young people to be involved in the community as long as possible
                            creating real paths to social inclusion.
